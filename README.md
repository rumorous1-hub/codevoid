# Base44 Project
Use this repository to run and edit the app locally, then publish changes back through Base44.
Any change pushed to the repo will also be reflected in the Base44 Builder.
## Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Install the Base44 CLI: `npm install -g base44@latest`.
See the [Base44 CLI docs](https://docs.base44.com/developers/references/cli/get-started/overview) if you want to run Base44 commands directly.
## Run Locally
Run the full local development environment from the project root:
```bash
base44 dev
```
`base44 dev` starts the local Base44 development backend and, when this app is configured for it, also starts the frontend dev server for you. Use the frontend URL printed by the command.
For example, when the Base44 project config includes a `serveCommand`, `base44 dev` can launch the frontend too:
```json5
{
  "site": {
    "serveCommand": "npm run dev"
  }
}
```
In a Base44 project this lives in `base44/config.jsonc`.
## Run Only The Frontend
If you only want to work on the frontend against the hosted Base44 backend, run:
```bash
npm run dev
